# Export Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive export system implemented for both Admin and Teacher roles with multiple format support:
- **CSV**: For data analysis (raw data)
- **PDF**: For reporting with charts, graphs, and signature placeholders
- **Table**: Excel/Google Sheets files (.xlsx format)

## Admin Export Functions
- **Users Export**: All user data including students and teachers
- **Clubs Export**: All club information with membership counts
- **Action Logs Export**: System activity logs for auditing

## Teacher Export Functions (Club-specific)
- **Club Membership**: Member details, roles, and joining information
- **Club Events**: Event details with approval status and dates
- **Voting Results**: Election results with candidate vote counts

## Technical Implementation

### Export Classes (Laravel Excel)
1. `UsersExport.php` - User data with sections and classes
2. `ClubsExport.php` - Club information with adviser details
3. `ActionLogsExport.php` - System action logs
4. `ClubMembershipExport.php` - Club member details
5. `ClubEventsExport.php` - Club event information
6. `VotingResultsExport.php` - Election and voting data

### Controller Methods
- `ExportController@exportUsers` - Admin only
- `ExportController@exportClubs` - Admin only
- `ExportController@exportActionLogs` - Admin only
- `ExportController@exportClubMembership` - Teachers with club access
- `ExportController@exportClubEvents` - Teachers with club access

### Routes
Admin routes (protected by admin middleware):
- `/admin/export/users?format={csv|pdf|table}`
- `/admin/export/clubs?format={csv|pdf|table}`
- `/admin/export/action-logs?format={csv|pdf|table}`

Teacher routes (club-specific):
- `/clubs/{club}/export/membership?format={csv|json|pdf|table}`
- `/clubs/{club}/export/events?format={csv|json|pdf|table}`
- `/clubs/{club}/export/voting-results?format={csv|json|pdf|table}`

### Data Accuracy
All exports use proper model relationships and match the database table structure:
- Users: `tbl_users` with sections and school classes
- Clubs: `tbl_clubs` with adviser relationships
- Action Logs: `action_logs` with user information
- Club Membership: `tbl_club_membership` with user and club details
- Events: `tbl_events` with organizer and club information
- Voting: `tbl_elections`, `tbl_votes`, `tbl_vote_details` with candidates

### PDF Features

- Signature placeholder sections for official documents
- Club-specific branding and information headers
- Responsive design for printing

### Excel Features
- Proper column headers and data mapping
- Bold header styling
- Formatted dates and numbers
