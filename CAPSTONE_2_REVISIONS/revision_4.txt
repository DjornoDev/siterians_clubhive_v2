# CAPSTONE PROJECT - REVISION 4 CHANGELOG
## ClubHive - File Upload Implementation for Posts & Club Registration Questions

### Date: August 15, 2025
### Revision Type: Feature Enhancement

---

## ISSUES ADDRESSED

### 1. File Upload for Posts
**Problem Statement:** The post creation functionality lacked file upload capabilities despite having database support for file attachments. Users could only upload images but not documents, PDFs, or other file types that are commonly needed for club activities and announcements.

### 2. Club Registration Questions System
**Problem Statement:** Club advisers had no way to create custom questions for students who want to join their clubs. There was no mechanism to collect additional information from prospective members before approving join requests.
